# What is Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS?<a name="what-is-rosa"></a>

 Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS \(ROSA\) is a managed service that’s available through the AWS Management Console\. With ROSA, as a Red Hat OpenShift user, you can build, scale, and manage containerized applications on AWS\. You can use ROSA to create Kubernetes clusters using the Red Hat OpenShift APIs and tools, and have access to the full breadth and depth of AWS services\. ROSA streamlines moving on\-premises Red Hat OpenShift workloads to AWS, and offers tight integration with other AWS services\. You can also access Red Hat OpenShift licensing, billing, and support all directly through AWS\.

There are no up\-front costs required to use ROSA\. You pay only for the container clusters and nodes that you use\. With pay\-as\-you\-go pricing, you don’t have to worry about complex, multi\-year contracts\. This flexibility means that you can use Red Hat OpenShift according to your specific business needs\.

## How ROSA works<a name="a"></a>

![\[How it works\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ROSA/latest/userguide/images/rosa-how-it-works.png)

Each ROSA cluster comes with a fully managed control plane and compute nodes\. Installation, management, maintenance, and upgrades are performed by Red Hat site reliability engineers \(SRE\) with joint Red Hat and Amazon support\. ROSA clusters are deployed in your account with support for existing VPCs\.

**Note**  
By default, Red Hat manages all ROSA clusters using the same restrictions, quotas, expectations, and configurations\.
